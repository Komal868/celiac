    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>üåæ What is Celiac Disease?</h2>
      <p>
        Celiac disease is an <strong>autoimmune disorder</strong> where the immune system reacts 
        abnormally to gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye). When people with 
        celiac disease eat gluten, their immune system attacks the small intestine, 
        causing damage to the lining and making it difficult to absorb nutrients properly.

    <!-- Symptoms -->
    <section>
      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may not even show obvious digestive issues, while others face severe problems. Common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent diarrhea or constipation</li>
        <li>Stomach pain, bloating, and gas</li>
        <li>Weight loss or poor growth in children</li>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
        <li>Iron-deficiency anemia</li>
        <li>Skin rashes (Dermatitis Herpetiformis)</li>
        <li>Bone or joint pain</li>
        <li>Mood changes (anxiety, depression)</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Causes -->
    <section>
      <h2>üß¨ Why Does Celiac Disease Happen?</h2>
      <p>
        The exact cause is not fully known, but it develops from a combination of 
        <strong>genetics</strong> and <strong>environmental triggers</strong>. 
        People with certain genes (HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8) are more likely to develop the disease. 
        Sometimes, it may be triggered after surgery, pregnancy, viral infections, or severe stress.

    <!-- Complications -->
    <section>
      <h2>üö® Complications if Untreated</h2>
      <p>
        If celiac disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious health issues such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malnutrition (due to poor nutrient absorption)</li>
        <li>Osteoporosis (weak bones)</li>
        <li>Infertility or miscarriage</li>
        <li>Nervous system problems (headaches, seizures, neuropathy)</li>
        <li>Increased risk of certain cancers (rare but possible)</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Living with Celiac -->
    <section>
      <h2>ü•ó Living with Celiac Disease</h2>
      <p>
        The only effective treatment is a <strong>strict gluten-free diet</strong>. 
        By avoiding foods that contain gluten and choosing safe alternatives, 
        people with celiac disease can live healthy, active lives. 
        Support groups, dieticians, and awareness can make this journey easier.
